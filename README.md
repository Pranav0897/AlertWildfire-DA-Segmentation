# Domain Adaptation for semantic segmentation of Smoke
## Course project for CSE291: Domain Adaptation in Computer Vision, Winter 2021, UCSD
## Pranav Verma, Sanika Patange, Satyam Gaba, Jessica

This project consists of multiple experiments, each in their own subdirectories. We describe each of them briefly. Instructions on how to run them are in the respective subdirectories.

- AdaptSegNet: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation method for semantic segmentation. Adapted from Tsai et al.'s [[1]](#1) work, from their GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/wasidennis/AdaptSegNet)
    - To run this, 
- smoke-advent: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for semantic segmentation using Entropy Minimization. Adapted from Vu et al.'s [[2]](#2) work, from their Github repository [here](https://github.com/valeoai/ADVENT) 
- Generative Adversarial Networks for Image style transfer:
  - CycleGAN [[3]](#3)
  - Pix2Pix GAN [[4]](#4)
- Deep FCNs for smoke segmentation: UNet [[5]](#5)
